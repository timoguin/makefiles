This section should be updated with every release. It contains a sequence of
links to GitHub that show the full Git diff between each release. The brackets
allow us to render the version headers as links by adding brackets to any
matching headers. Any commits that don't yet belong to a Git tag will show the
Git diff from the last tag to the master branch HEAD.
